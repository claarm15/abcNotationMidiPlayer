Just general note file... nothing precise or part of the code.  Just a place for me to keep track of my thoughts.

Already done...		 
	sample1,2,3,scale, and piece1 all working properly.
	
TODO
	Remove /bin from git
	
	Need to work on parsing how many notes in a sequence and work out the timing
	
	Need an interface
	
	Combine TestPages to TestSuite so I can run them all at once.
